Course Title
Bhāvanā Adhyayana: Conceptual Mathematic in Mother Tongues

Course Instructor
Mr. Posina Venkata Rayudu

Course Description
Bhāvanā Adhyayana: Conceptual Mathematic in Mother Tongues is a study of concepts in general and abstraction of mathematical concepts from commonplace categorical perception in particular.  Mathematics is mistakenly equated with numbers and calculations; the present course is a long-overdue corrective scientific outreach intended to bring into figural salience for all to see the significance of ideas and their geometric objectification in constructing a connected conceptual architecture that is mathematic.  Recognition of the primacy of concepts is facilitated throughout the course by way of encouraging students to create words in their mother tongues that fit mathematical concepts presented in English language.

Learning Objectives
This course is not about calculating correct answers quickly!  The main objectives of Bhāvanā Adhyayana are (i) to introduce students to a cohesive body of concepts that’s adequate for abstracting mathematical essence(s) of any subject matter, including anthropology, cognitive science, consciousness studies, design science, education, history, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology, in addition to computer science, engineering, and physics that are reflexively associated with mathematics and (ii) to prepare students to think about mathematics in their mother tongues, with the attendant comprehension being indispensable for making original contributions to the advancement of science (as opposed to servicing western imperialism).

Pre-requisites for registration/auditing
No formal training in mathematics or concepts (beyond that of high school) is required.  Advanced mathematical concepts and constructions will be introduced in a manner comprehensible to all.  However, those of us championing anglo-american colonialism may find this course unpalatable.
